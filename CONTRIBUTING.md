# Contributing

Internal guide for the Brite Nites team working on this plugin bundle.

## Plugin Philosophy

This is a **Process + Org plugin**. When adding new components:

- **Process skills** (how to work): writing-plans, executing-plans, debugging methodology — YES
- **Org commands** (team workflows): sprint-planning, retrospective, deployment-checklist — YES
- **Domain skills** (tech-stack knowledge): Python patterns, Shopify docs, database guides — NO (create a separate domain plugin instead)

If you're unsure whether something belongs here, ask: "Is this about *how* we work, or *what* we know about a technology?" Process and workflow → this plugin. Technology knowledge → separate domain plugin.

## Quick Reference

### Add a command

1. Create `plugins/workflows/commands/my-command.md`
2. Add YAML frontmatter with `description`
3. Write instructions in markdown — use `$ARGUMENTS` for user input

### Add a skill

1. Create `plugins/workflows/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`
2. Add frontmatter matching the [standard](#skillmd-frontmatter-standard) below
3. Ensure `name` matches the directory name exactly
4. Write skill instructions in markdown

### Add an agent

1. Create `plugins/workflows/agents/my-agent.md`
2. Add frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`
3. Write system prompt with role and principles
4. Reference from a skill via `agent: my-agent` in the skill's frontmatter

### Add a hook

1. Edit `plugins/workflows/hooks/hooks.json`
2. Add to the appropriate event (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`)
3. Choose type: `prompt` (LLM-evaluated) or `command` (shell script)
4. Set a `matcher` regex for which tools trigger the hook
5. Run `python3 -m json.tool hooks/hooks.json` to validate JSON

## plugin.json Schema (STRICT — read before editing)

**Claude Code validates plugin.json against a strict Zod schema. Any unrecognized field causes a silent hard failure — the entire plugin won't load (no commands, no skills, nothing). There is no error message shown to the user.**

Only these fields are recognized:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `name` | string | yes | |
| `description` | string | yes | |
| `author` | `{ name, email? }` | yes | |
| `version` | string | no | Must bump for cache invalidation |
| `homepage` | string | no | |
| `repository` | string | no | |
| `license` | string | no | |
| `keywords` | string[] | no | |
| `commands` | string | no | Path to commands dir (e.g., `"./commands/"`) |
| `skills` | string | no | Path to skills dir (e.g., `"./skills/"`) |
| `mcpServers` | object | no | **Inline object only**, not a file path |

**NEVER add these to plugin.json** (they are auto-discovered from the plugin root):
- `agents` — the `agents/` directory is scanned automatically
- `hooks` — `hooks/hooks.json` is loaded automatically
- `mcpServers` as a string path (e.g., `"./.mcp.json"`) — `.mcp.json` is loaded automatically. If you must declare MCP servers in plugin.json, use the inline object format.

The `scripts/validate.sh` pre-push hook and CI workflow both enforce this allowlist.

## SKILL.md Frontmatter Standard

```yaml
---
name: skill-name              # Required. Must match the directory name.
description: When to use...   # Required. Unquoted plain YAML string.
user-invocable: true           # Required. Explicit true or false.
allowed-tools: Tool(pattern)   # Optional. Only when skill needs specific tool permissions.
license: MIT                   # Optional. SPDX identifier for third-party content.
metadata:                      # Optional. Only for skills from external sources.
  author: source-org
  version: "1.0.0"
---
```

**Rules:**
- `name` must match the skill's directory name (`skills/react-best-practices/` → `name: react-best-practices`)
- `description` must not be quoted — use plain YAML string (no `>` folded blocks, no `"..."`)
- `user-invocable` must always be explicit — never rely on defaults
- `license` is only needed for third-party content
- `metadata` is only needed for skills ported from external sources

**Agent-linked skills** also use:
- `agent: agent-name` — references an agent in `agents/`
- `context: fork` — intended for isolated execution (currently has upstream bugs, runs inline)

## Hooks

The plugin includes hooks in `plugins/workflows/hooks/hooks.json` (auto-loaded by Claude Code — do NOT add a `hooks` field to `plugin.json`):

- **PreToolUse (Bash)**: Two-layer security — regex command hook (deterministic, blocks `rm -rf`, `--force`, `DROP`, `chmod 777`, piped downloads) runs first, then Haiku prompt hook as fallback
- **PreToolUse (Bash)**: Pre-commit quality — intercepts `git commit` commands, detects project type (`package.json` → JS/TS, `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py` → Python), runs linters on staged files only (ESLint, `tsc --noEmit`, Ruff). Degrades gracefully if no linters installed. Note: inactive from plugins until upstream [#6305](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6305) is fixed.
- **PreToolUse (Write/Edit)**: Two-layer security — regex command hook (deterministic, blocks `sk-proj-`, `AKIA`, `ghp_`, `sk_live/test` patterns) runs first, then Haiku prompt hook as fallback
- **PostToolUse (Write/Edit)**: Auto-linter — runs ESLint (JS/TS) or Ruff (Python) if available
- **SessionStart**: Team context — runs environment health checks (git, node, gh, npx) and shows key commands

A standalone version of the pre-commit hook is available at `scripts/pre-commit.sh` for direct installation as a git hook (`cp scripts/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit`). This works today regardless of the upstream plugin hook bug.

## ADR Convention

Architecture Decision Records live in `docs/decisions/NNN-kebab-title.md`. They are imported into CLAUDE.md via individual `@` imports (directory imports are not supported). The `/workflows:architecture-decision` command generates ADRs and auto-appends the import. `/workflows:project-start` generates ADRs for all major tech decisions made during the interview.

## Branch Conventions

Branch from `main`. Use these prefixes:

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feat/` | New feature (command, skill, agent) | `feat/deploy-command` |
| `fix/` | Bug fix | `fix/hook-matcher-regex` |
| `docs/` | Documentation only | `docs/architecture-guide` |

## Commit Messages

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch with the appropriate prefix
2. Make your changes
3. Push and open a PR against `main`
4. CI runs automatically (see [CI Checks](#ci-checks) below)
5. PR description should include:
   - What changed and why
   - Which components were added/modified (commands, skills, agents, hooks)
   - How to test the changes

## CI Checks

The GitHub Actions workflow (`validate-plugin.yml`) validates on every push/PR to `main`:

| Check | What it validates |
|-------|-------------------|
| JSON validity | `marketplace.json`, `plugin.json`, `hooks.json` parse correctly |
| Required fields | `plugin.json` has `name`, `description`, `author` |
| Directory existence | `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` exist |
| Command frontmatter | Every `commands/*.md` has `---` block with `description` |
| Skill frontmatter | Every `skills/*/SKILL.md` has `name`, `description`, `user-invocable` |
| Skill name matching | `name` field matches the directory name |
| Hooks structure | `hooks.json` is valid JSON with proper event/handler structure |

## Testing Changes Locally

### Automated validation

Run the validation script (requires `python3`):

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

This mirrors all CI checks plus additional ones: marketplace field validation, path resolution, `allowed-tools` format, `argument-hint` nesting, agent frontmatter, and cross-reference integrity.

To run validation automatically before every push:

```bash
./scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

### Manual testing

After `./scripts/validate.sh` passes, see [`docs/testing-guide.md`](docs/testing-guide.md) for the full interactive testing checklist (51 tests across 7 layers). For quick validation, use the **Quick Smoke Subset** section (~10 min).

## Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes to plugin structure or command interfaces
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New commands, skills, agents, or hooks
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, documentation updates, typo corrections

When bumping a version:

1. Update `version` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (under the plugin's entry)
2. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` or a new version heading
3. Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format

## Skill Routing Updates

When adding a new design-related skill, check the routing table in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#design-skills-three-way-split). Design skills must have distinct trigger language to avoid conflicts:

- **Implementation** triggers: "build", "create", "implement", "code"
- **Planning** triggers: "choose", "plan", "explore", "brainstorm"
- **Review** triggers: "review", "audit", "check", "evaluate"

Write the `description` field to clearly signal which category the skill belongs to.

## Using `_shared/` Utilities

Two shared files in `skills/_shared/` are available for any skill to reference:

| File | What it provides |
|------|------------------|
| `validation-pattern.md` | Self-validation & retry loop (check → evaluate → retry 3x → flag for human) |
| `output-formats.md` | Standard severity levels, finding format, summary/progress blocks |

To use them, add to your skill's instructions:

```markdown
### Validation Criteria
Read `.claude/skills/_shared/validation-pattern.md` and apply it.
```

Do not duplicate the shared content into individual skills.
