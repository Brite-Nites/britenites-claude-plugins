# Scoping Session

You are facilitating a collaborative creative session to decide what to build next. This replaces formal sprint ceremonies with Socratic discovery. The output is a prioritized set of Linear issues ready for execution.

## Step 0: Verify Prerequisites

Before starting, confirm critical dependencies:

1. **Linear MCP** — Call the Linear MCP to list projects (just 1 result). This confirms auth and connectivity.
2. **Sequential-thinking MCP** — Send a trivial thought (e.g., "Planning scope session"). This confirms the MCP server is running.

If either fails:
- Stop with: "Cannot reach [Linear/sequential-thinking]. Run `/britenites:smoke-test` to diagnose."

## Step 1: Interview Phase

Start a Socratic dialogue to understand what the developer wants to accomplish. Ask **1-2 questions at a time** using AskUserQuestion.

### Opening Questions
- "What's on your mind? What problems, opportunities, or ideas are you thinking about?"
- "Is this about a specific project, or are you exploring something new?"

### Dig Deeper
- "Who is affected by this? What's the impact if we don't do it?"
- "What does 'done' look like for this? How would you know it's working?"
- "What's blocking progress right now? What's the bottleneck?"
- "Is there a deadline or trigger event driving this?"

### Challenge & Expand
- "What if we did the simplest possible version? What's the MVP?"
- "What's the risk of doing nothing?"
- "Are there related problems we should solve at the same time?"
- "What have you already tried or considered?"

Adapt your questions to the conversation. Don't follow a script — follow the thread.

## Step 2: Context Gathering

While discussing, silently gather context to inform the conversation:

1. **Linear backlog** — Query open issues in the active project. Are there existing issues that relate to what the developer is describing?
2. **Recent compound learnings** — Read auto-memory for session summaries from recent work. What patterns, pain points, or follow-ups were noted?
3. **CLAUDE.md insights** — Read the project CLAUDE.md for architecture context, gotchas, and current state
4. **Recent PRs** — Check `git log --oneline -20` for recent work that might inform priorities

Share relevant findings:
- "I see there's already BRI-42 in the backlog about auth improvements — does that overlap with what you're describing?"
- "In the last session, you noted that the API response times were a pain point. Should we factor that in?"

## Step 3: Collaborative Ideation

Use sequential-thinking MCP to structure the ideation:

1. **Synthesize themes** from the interview into 3-5 areas of work
2. **For each theme**, generate 2-3 concrete features or improvements
3. **Present to the developer**:

```
## Themes & Ideas

### Theme 1: [Name]
- [Feature/improvement A] — [one-line impact]
- [Feature/improvement B] — [one-line impact]
- [Feature/improvement C] — [one-line impact]

### Theme 2: [Name]
...
```

4. **Discuss**: Which resonate? What's missing? What should we drop?
5. **Refine**: Narrow to the set of things worth building

## Step 4: Issue Creation

For each item the developer wants to pursue, create a Linear issue:

### Issue Template

Use `mcp__plugin_britenites_linear-server__save_issue` with:

- **Title**: Clear, imperative, under 70 characters
- **Description**: Structured markdown with:
  ```markdown
  ## Context
  [Why this matters — background from the scoping conversation]

  ## What
  [What to build — specific enough for an agent to start]

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] [Concrete, verifiable criterion]
  - [ ] [Concrete, verifiable criterion]

  ## Notes
  [Tradeoffs discussed, decisions made, out-of-scope items]
  ```
- **Priority**: 1 (Urgent), 2 (High), 3 (Normal), 4 (Low)
- **Labels**: Relevant labels from the project
- **Project**: The active project

### Relationships
- Set `blocks` and `blockedBy` for dependency relationships
- Set `relatedTo` for issues that share context but aren't dependent

## Step 5: Prioritization

After creating issues, present the full list and prioritize together:

```
## Created Issues

| # | ID | Title | Priority | Depends On |
|---|---------|-------------------------------|----------|------------|
| 1 | BRI-XX | [Title] | High | — |
| 2 | BRI-XX | [Title] | High | BRI-XX |
| 3 | BRI-XX | [Title] | Normal | — |
...

**Suggested order**: Start with #1 (no dependencies, high impact), then #2 (unblocked after #1).
```

Ask: "Does this ordering make sense? Want to adjust priorities or dependencies?"

If the developer wants to start working immediately, suggest: "Ready for `/britenites:session-start` to pick up the top issue."

## Step 6: Session Summary

```
## Scoping Complete

**Issues created**: [N]
**Themes covered**: [list]
**Top priority**: [Issue ID] — [Title]
**Estimated scope**: [Small / Medium / Large]

**Key decisions**:
- [Decision made during scoping]
- [Decision made during scoping]

**Deferred**:
- [Ideas discussed but not pursued — captured for future reference]
```

Write deferred ideas to auto-memory so they're not lost.

## Rules

- This is a creative conversation, not a form. Follow the developer's energy.
- Never create issues without the developer's explicit approval of each one.
- Every issue must have acceptance criteria — "make it better" is not a criterion.
- Surface existing backlog items that relate to the discussion — don't create duplicates.
- The retrospective function is built in: compound learnings from previous sessions provide the "what worked/didn't" data.
- Keep the session focused — if scope is expanding uncontrollably, call it out: "We have [N] items now. Should we stop here and prioritize, or keep going?"
- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a specific topic, focus the interview on that topic.
