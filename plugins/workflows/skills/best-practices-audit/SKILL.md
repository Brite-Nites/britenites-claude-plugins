description: Audits and auto-fixes a project's CLAUDE.md against Anthropic best practices. Activates during ship phase — checks conciseness, enforces @import structure for detailed docs, auto-excludes bloat, identifies hook candidates, and auto-fixes structural issues. Flags content questions for developer review.

# Best Practices Audit

You are auditing a project's CLAUDE.md to ensure it follows Anthropic's official best practices and stays effective as the project evolves. This runs after compound learnings are captured, to catch any drift.

## When to Activate

- Invoked by the `ship` command after compound-learnings
- The `/workflows:setup-claude-md` command includes similar audit logic
- After significant CLAUDE.md changes

## Reference

Read the best-practices reference from `.claude/skills/setup-claude-md/claude-code-best-practices.md`. If the file is not accessible, use the audit checklist below as the authoritative guide.

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Size Check

CLAUDE.md should be under ~100 lines. Performance degrades with length.

- **Under 80 lines**: Good
- **80-120 lines**: Acceptable, look for extraction opportunities
- **Over 120 lines**: Must extract sections to `docs/` with `@import`

### 2. Required Sections

Every CLAUDE.md should have (in this order):

```
## Build & Test Commands     — How to build, test, lint, typecheck
## Code Conventions          — Only non-obvious, project-specific ones
## Architecture Decisions    — Key patterns and data flow
## Gotchas & Workarounds     — Things that will bite you
```

Optional but valuable:
```
## Environment Setup         — env vars, secrets, dependencies
## Workflow Rules            — branch, commit, PR conventions
```

Flag missing required sections.

### 3. @import Structure

Detailed documentation should be extracted to `docs/` and referenced via `@import`:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md (short, focused)
@docs/api-conventions.md
@docs/data-model.md
@docs/deployment.md
```

**Check for**:
- Sections over ~10 lines that are domain-specific → extract to `docs/`
- Architecture docs inline → extract to `docs/architecture.md`
- Convention details inline → extract to `docs/conventions.md`
- API documentation inline → extract or use context7 instead

### 4. Auto-Exclude Patterns

Flag and suggest removal of:

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Standard language conventions | Claude already knows these |
| "Write clean code" / "Follow best practices" | Self-evident |
| Detailed API documentation | Link to docs or use context7 |
| File-by-file codebase descriptions | Claude can read the code |
| Long explanations or tutorials | Extract to docs/ |
| Information that changes frequently | Will go stale quickly |
| Generic advice not specific to this project | Adds noise without value |

### 5. Command Accuracy

Verify all commands in CLAUDE.md actually work:

1. Read `package.json` scripts (or equivalent)
2. Cross-reference with CLAUDE.md build/test/lint commands
3. Flag any commands that don't match reality:
   - Command listed but script doesn't exist
   - Script exists but command not listed
   - Command syntax is wrong

### 6. Hook Candidates

Identify CLAUDE.md rules that should be deterministic hooks instead:

- "Always run lint before committing" → pre-commit hook
- "Never use `any` type" → TypeScript strict config
- "Format with Prettier" → PostToolUse format hook
- "Check for secrets before pushing" → PreToolUse hook

Advisory rules that can be enforced deterministically should be hooks, not CLAUDE.md lines.

### 7. Staleness Check

Look for entries that reference:
- Files that no longer exist
- Patterns that were replaced
- Dependencies that were removed
- Commands that were changed
- Conventions that evolved

## Auto-Fix vs Flag

### Auto-Fix (do silently)
- Reorder sections to match the recommended order
- Remove obviously self-evident entries ("write clean code")
- Fix command syntax if the correct command is clear from `package.json`
- Extract sections over 10 lines to `docs/` with `@import` (create the file)

### Flag for Developer (ask before changing)
- Removing content that might be intentional
- Changing conventions that affect team workflow
- Adding new sections based on codebase analysis
- Pruning entries you're not 100% certain are stale

## Report

```
## CLAUDE.md Audit

**Size**: [N] lines ([status: good / needs extraction / critical])

**Auto-fixed**:
- [list of changes made automatically]

**Needs your input**:
- [list of flagged items with context]

**Recommendations**:
- [suggestions for improvement]

**Hook candidates**:
- [rules that should become hooks]
```

## Rules

- Every line in CLAUDE.md should earn its place — one precise instruction is worth ten generic ones
- Auto-fix structural issues but never auto-remove content without flagging
- The goal is a CLAUDE.md that makes agents maximally effective, not one that documents everything
- Reference `_shared/validation-pattern.md` for self-checking
- Prefer `@import` for anything that would make the core file unwieldy
- Don't add sections for the sake of completeness — only add what's genuinely useful
