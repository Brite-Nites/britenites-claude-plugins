# Comprehensive Testing Guide

Complete testing reference for the Brite Claude Code plugin. Covers automated validation, interactive skill/command testing, end-to-end flows, hooks, and agent dispatch.

Use this guide when working on the plugin itself or when verifying behavior after changes.

## Prerequisites

- Fresh terminal (not inside Claude)
- Plugin installed or loaded via `--plugin-dir`
- A test Linear project with at least 1 open issue
- GitHub CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- A test project directory for commands that write files (e.g., `/tmp/test-project`)

## Quick Smoke Subset (~10 min)

For fast validation after changes, run only these:

1. T0.1 + T0.2 + T0.6 — automated scripts pass
2. T1.1 + T1.2 — plugin loads, SessionStart fires
3. T1.3 — smoke-test command
4. T2.1 + T2.7 + T2.9 — one skill from each category triggers
5. T3.1 — tech-stack renders
6. T3.6 — code-review quick mode on a diff

---

## Layer 0: Automated Validation (~2 min)

Run these outside Claude, from a regular terminal or CI.

| Test | Command | Expected |
|------|---------|----------|
| T0.1 Structural validation | `bash scripts/validate.sh` | 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| T0.2 Hook regex tests | `bash scripts/test-hooks.sh` | 37/37 pass |
| T0.3 Prerequisites check | `bash scripts/check-prereqs.sh` | All PASS (or explained SKIPs) |
| T0.4 Command registration | `bash scripts/test-plugin-load.sh` | All 21 commands found |
| T0.5 CI workflow | Push to branch, check GitHub Actions | All steps green |
| T0.6 Scenario validation | `bash scripts/test-scenarios.sh` | 225/225 pass (60 scenarios + 12 FP regressions + 6 express mode, 7 categories) |

---

## Layer 1: Plugin Loading & Environment (~3 min)

| Test | Steps | Expected |
|------|-------|----------|
| T1.1 Plugin loads | Start `claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/workflows`, type `/workflows:` | 21 commands in autocomplete: `architecture-decision`, `audit-trail`, `bug-report`, `code-review`, `create-plugin`, `deployment-checklist`, `fact-check`, `flywheel-metrics`, `onboarding-checklist`, `project-start`, `promote-precedent`, `retrospective`, `review`, `scope`, `security-audit`, `session-start`, `setup-claude-md`, `ship`, `smoke-test`, `sprint-planning`, `tech-stack` |
| T1.2 SessionStart hook | Observe session start output | Environment banner with git/node/gh/npx status + key commands listed |
| T1.3 Smoke test | Run `/workflows:smoke-test` | Summary table with PASS/FAIL/SKIP/KNOWN ISSUE for 8 checks (env, MCP, hooks, agents) |

---

## Layer 2: Skill Trigger Tests (~10 min)

Test that saying specific phrases activates the correct skill. Verify by observing which skill name appears in the response context.

### Inner Loop Skills

| Test | Say this | Expected skill |
|------|----------|----------------|
| T2.1 | "I need to plan a new feature for user onboarding" | `brainstorming` |
| T2.2 | "I have a bug that's hard to reproduce" | `systematic-debugging` |
| T2.3 | (after brainstorming) Plan is presented | `writing-plans` |
| T2.4 | (after plan approval) Worktree setup begins | `git-worktrees` |
| T2.5 | (after worktree) Execution begins | `executing-plans` |
| T2.6 | (during execution) Checkpoint verification | `verification-before-completion` |

Note: T2.3–T2.6 are sequential — they trigger as part of the inner loop flow and are also tested in Layer 4 (T4.1).

### Design Skills

| Test | Say this | Expected skill |
|------|----------|----------------|
| T2.7 | "Build a login form with email and password" | `frontend-design` |
| T2.8 | "Choose a color palette for a SaaS dashboard" | `ui-ux-pro-max` |
| T2.9 | "Review my UI for accessibility issues" | `web-design-guidelines` |

### Quality / Reference Skills

| Test | Say this | Expected skill |
|------|----------|----------------|
| T2.10 | "Review this React component for performance" | `react-best-practices` |
| T2.11 | "Set up ESLint and Prettier for this project" | `code-quality` |
| T2.12 | "Find a skill for database migrations" | `find-skills` |

---

## Layer 4: End-to-End Flow Tests (~30+ min each)

### T4.1: Inner Loop (full cycle)

**Prerequisites:** Linear project with an open issue, gh authenticated, test repo

1. `/workflows:session-start` → select an issue
2. Observe `brainstorming` activates (if non-trivial) → approve design doc
3. Observe `writing-plans` activates → review plan with tasks → approve
4. Observe `git-worktrees` activates → worktree created with issue ID branch
5. Observe `executing-plans` activates → subagents dispatched per task → TDD enforced
6. Observe `verification-before-completion` runs at checkpoints
7. `/workflows:review` → dynamic agent selection → agents run in parallel → P1s fixed → verdict
8. `/workflows:ship` → PR created → Linear updated → `compound-learnings` runs → `best-practices-audit` runs (if CLAUDE.md changed) → session summary

**Cleanup:** Delete test PR, remove worktree, clean up generated files.

### T4.2: Greenfield Flow

**Prerequisites:** Empty directory, Linear MCP

1. `/workflows:project-start` → complete full interview
2. Verify trait classification and scaffolding:
   - Trait classification shown with confidence levels (High/Medium/Low)
   - `## Project Traits` section in CLAUDE.md with active trait list, autonomy level, and per-trait evidence
   - Trait-conditional docs scaffolded per trait-to-doc mapping (e.g., `docs/engineering-context.md` for `produces-code`)
   - Linear `trait:<name>` labels created for each active trait
   - CLAUDE.md structure: always-include sections (6) + trait-conditional sections + autonomy-conditional sections (Technical Vision only if Autonomy B)
   - `docs/project-plan-v1.md` created, Linear project created
3. `/workflows:post-plan-setup` → refine-plan runs → approve → create-issues runs → approve → setup-claude-md runs → approve
4. Verify: `docs/project-plan-refined.md` exists, Linear issues created with dependencies, CLAUDE.md updated

**Cleanup:** Delete test Linear project and issues.

### T4.3: Scoping Flow

**Prerequisites:** Linear project with existing issues

1. `/workflows:scope` → answer interview questions → themes generated → select items → issues created → prioritization table
2. Verify: Linear issues created with acceptance criteria, relationships set, deferred ideas in memory

**Cleanup:** Delete test issues.

### T4.4: Standalone Debugging

**Prerequisites:** A project with a reproducible bug (or simulate one)

1. Say "I have a bug: [description]"
2. Observe `systematic-debugging` activates
3. Walk through: Phase 1 (reproduce) → Phase 2 (isolate) → Phase 3 (analyze) → Phase 4 (fix)
4. Verify: Regression test written, debugging report generated

---

## Layer 5: Hook Tests (~5 min)

**Note:** PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks don't fire from plugins due to upstream bug ([#6305](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6305)). These tests verify the hook *definitions* are correct and will work once the bug is fixed. SessionStart is the only hook that fires today.

| Test | Hook | Steps | Expected |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| T5.1 | SessionStart | Start a new session | Environment banner displayed with git/node/gh/npx status |
| T5.2 | Bash security (automated) | Already covered by `scripts/test-hooks.sh` | 37/37 pass |
| T5.3 | Write/Edit security (manual) | Try to write a file containing `sk-proj-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` | Should be blocked (if hooks fire — KNOWN ISSUE if not) |
| T5.4 | PostToolUse linter (manual) | Edit a `.ts` file with a lint error | Auto-linter should run (if hooks fire — KNOWN ISSUE if not) |

---

## Layer 6: Agent Dispatch Tests (~10 min)

| Test | Agent | How to trigger | Expected output |
|------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| T6.1 | `code-reviewer` | `/workflows:review` or `/workflows:code-review --deep` | P1/P2/P3 findings with file:line references |
| T6.2 | `security-reviewer` | `/workflows:review` or `/workflows:security-audit` | Security findings with Attack/Impact/Fix + Risk Level |
| T6.3 | `typescript-reviewer` | `/workflows:review` | TypeScript/React/Next.js findings |
| T6.4 | `claude-md-generator` | `/workflows:setup-claude-md` | CLAUDE.md generated with required sections |
| T6.5 | `plan-refiner` | `/workflows:post-plan-setup` Phase 1 | Refined plan with agent-ready tasks |
| T6.6 | `issue-creator` | `/workflows:post-plan-setup` Phase 2 | Linear issues created with structured descriptions |
| T6.7 | `post-plan-orchestrator` | `/workflows:post-plan-setup` | Orchestrates phases 1–3 with review gates |
| T6.8 | `performance-reviewer` | `/workflows:review` (always selected) | Performance findings with complexity/impact analysis |
| T6.9 | `python-reviewer` | `/workflows:review` (when `pyproject.toml` exists) | Python/FastAPI findings with type/async analysis |
| T6.10 | `data-reviewer` | `/workflows:review` (when `prisma/` or `migrations/` exists) | Migration safety and query pattern findings |
| T6.11 | `architecture-reviewer` | `/workflows:review` (when diff touches 5+ dirs, CLAUDE.md enables, or `comprehensive` depth) | Coupling, SOLID, boundary violation findings |
| T6.12 | `accessibility-reviewer` | `/workflows:review` (when CLAUDE.md enables or `comprehensive` depth) | WCAG compliance findings with success criterion references |
| T6.13 | Confidence filtering | `/workflows:review` on a branch with changes | Each finding has `Confidence: N/10`, Step 5 narration shows filtered count, low-confidence P2/P3s absent from report but counted, borderline P1s show "Needs Human Review", HTML report shows confidence pills, "show all" shows all findings |
| T6.14 | Depth modes | `/workflows:review fast`, `/workflows:review comprehensive` | `fast`: only 3 Tier 1 agents selected, Tier 2/3 skipped. `comprehensive`: all agents selected regardless of stack or CLAUDE.md overrides, narration shows override bypass. Default (no keyword): `thorough` behavior unchanged. Combined flags work: `fast skip simplify skip validation show all`. Whole-word matching: "fast-path" does not trigger `fast` mode |
| T6.15 | `test-quality-reviewer` | `/workflows:review` (when diff includes test files or CLAUDE.md enables) | Test quality findings: coverage gaps, behavior vs implementation, flakiness risk, edge cases, test structure |
| T6.16 | Diff triage — trivial | `/workflows:review` on a branch with only comment/doc changes (< 50 lines) | Step 2 narrates "Trivial diff detected", Steps 3-7 skipped, abbreviated visual report generated, verdict is "Trivial change — no review agents needed" |
| T6.17 | Diff triage — non-trivial | `/workflows:review` on a branch with logic changes | Step 2 narrates "Non-trivial diff", proceeds to Step 3 (simplify pass) and full review pipeline |
| T6.18 | Diff triage — skip flag | `/workflows:review skip triage` | Step 2 narrates "Diff triage skipped (user request)", proceeds directly to Step 3 |
| T6.19 | Validation — P1 confirmed | `/workflows:review` on a branch with a real bug | Step 6 dispatches Opus subagent for P1, verdict is CONFIRMED, finding remains in report |
| T6.20 | Validation — P1 downgraded | `/workflows:review` on a branch with a borderline P1 | Step 6 Opus subagent returns DOWNGRADED, finding reclassified to P2/P3 with "[Downgraded from P1]" note |
| T6.21 | Validation — finding dismissed | `/workflows:review` on a branch with false-positive-prone patterns | Step 6 subagent returns DISMISSED, finding removed from main report and added to "Dismissed by validation" appendix |
| T6.22 | Validation cap | `/workflows:review` on a branch with 25+ findings | Step 6 caps at 20 subagents, remaining P3s batched into single Sonnet subagent, all P1s validated individually |
| T6.23 | Validation — skip flag | `/workflows:review skip validation` | Step 6 narrates "Validation skipped (user request)", proceeds directly to Step 7 |
| T6.24 | Validation — fast mode P2/P3 skip | `/workflows:review fast` with P2/P3 findings but no P1s | Step 6 narrates "Validation skipped (fast mode, no P1s)", proceeds to Step 7 without dispatching subagents |
| T6.25 | Validation — fast mode P1 only | `/workflows:review fast` with P1 findings | Step 6 narrates "Validating P1s only (fast mode)", dispatches Opus subagents for P1s only, skips P2/P3 verification |
| T6.26 | `cdr-compliance-reviewer` | `/workflows:review` (when project CLAUDE.md has `## Company Context` with `handbook-library`, CLAUDE.md enables, or `comprehensive` depth) | CDR compliance findings with CDR ID references (e.g., CDR-001), Why/Fix fields, compliance verdict (`Compliant` / `Violation Found` / `Review Needed`), CDRs Checked count. When Context7 unavailable: graceful skip with `CDR Compliance: N/A (CDR INDEX unavailable)`. When no handbook-library: skip with `CDR Compliance: N/A (no handbook configured)`. |
