## 1. The Inner Loop

The inner loop is the core development workflow. You run **3 commands** — everything else activates automatically.

```
/workflows:session-start ──► brainstorm ──► plan ──► worktree ──► execute
                                                                      │
                                        ship ◄── /workflows:ship      │
                                          │                            │
                                          └── compound ── audit        │
                                                                       ▼
                                                            /workflows:review
```

### What you type

| Step | Command | When |
|------|---------|------|
| Start | `/workflows:session-start` | Beginning of a work session |
| Review | `/workflows:review` | After executing the plan |
| Ship | `/workflows:ship` | After review passes |

### What happens automatically

Between those 3 commands, skills activate in sequence based on the work:

1. **session-start** pulls latest, reads CLAUDE.md and auto-memory, checks Context7 availability, gathers company context (or skips if already set up), queries Linear for your next issue
2. **brainstorming** activates if complexity criteria are met (2+ modules, 4+ tasks, 2+ approaches, or new patterns) — searches past decision traces for prior art, then produces a design document via Socratic discovery
3. **writing-plans** checks Active CDRs from the handbook and searches project-level precedent INDEX for relevant past decisions (when company context is configured), then breaks the work into 2-5 minute tasks with exact file paths, verification steps, and TDD structure
4. **git-worktrees** creates an isolated branch and workspace, installs dependencies, verifies clean baseline
5. **executing-plans** runs each task via a fresh subagent with TDD enforcement (red-green-refactor) and checkpoints
6. **verification-before-completion** runs 4-level verification at each checkpoint during execution
7. After you run `/workflows:review`, a Haiku-powered diff triage gates trivial diffs, then a simplify pass runs 3 agents (code reuse, quality, efficiency) to auto-fix behavior-preserving improvements, then Opus-powered review agents are dynamically selected based on depth mode and your stack (3-10 agents) and run in parallel, findings are validated by per-finding subagents, and P1s are auto-fixed (up to 3 attempts)
8. After you run `/workflows:ship`, a PR is created, Linear is updated, then **compound-learnings** captures durable knowledge to CLAUDE.md and auto-memory, **best-practices-audit** keeps CLAUDE.md healthy, and **handbook-drift-check** detects if shipped changes require handbook updates

### Artifacts produced

| Phase | Artifact | Path |
|-------|----------|------|
| Brainstorming | Design document | `docs/designs/<issue-id>-<slug>.md` |
| Planning | Execution plan | `docs/plans/<issue-id>-plan.md` |
| Worktree | Isolated branch | `.claude/worktrees/<issue-id>/` |
| Ship | Pull request | GitHub |
| Ship | CLAUDE.md + memory updates | Project root + auto-memory |

## 3. Orchestrator Commands

### Inner Loop Commands

#### `/workflows:session-start`

Start a work session. Guides you from issue selection through execution.

| Step | Name | What happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Verify Prerequisites | Confirm Linear MCP, sequential-thinking MCP, Context7 MCP (non-blocking) |
| 1 | Environment Setup | Git pull, read CLAUDE.md + auto-memory |
| 2 | Company Context | Check for `## Company Context` in CLAUDE.md — run interview if missing, skip if present or opted out |
| 3 | Query Linear | Find in-progress issues first, then backlog; scoped to project in CLAUDE.md |
| 4 | Read Issue Details | Fetch full issue, linked docs, identify relevant code |
| 5 | Brainstorm | Objective complexity check — brainstorm if criteria met, skip if not |
| 6 | Write Plan | Break work into tasks, plan approval |
| 7 | Set Up Worktree | Isolated branch + dependency install + clean baseline |
| 8 | Execute | Subagent-per-task with TDD and checkpoints |

#### `/workflows:review`

Self-verify work, simplify code, run review agents in parallel, fix P1s.

**Depth Modes**

Control how many review agents run via `$ARGUMENTS`:

```
/workflows:review fast            # Tier 1 only (3 agents) — quick checks
/workflows:review                 # Tier 1 + Tier 2 (default, 3-6 agents)
/workflows:review thorough        # Explicit default — same as bare invocation
/workflows:review comprehensive   # All tiers (3-10 agents) — pre-release
```

| Mode | Agents | When to use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `fast` | Tier 1 only (code, security, performance) | Quick checks, small changes |
| `thorough` (default) | Tier 1 + Tier 2 (stack-conditional) | Normal reviews |
| `comprehensive` | All tiers including Tier 3 opt-ins | Major features, pre-release |

Depth can be combined with other flags: `/workflows:review fast skip triage skip simplify skip validation show all`.

| Step | Name | What happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Verify Agent Dispatch | Test Task tool with trivial agent before committing to parallel agents |
| 1 | Self-Verification | Check plan steps, run tests, verify build, review own diff |
| 2 | Diff Triage | Haiku agent classifies diff as trivial/non-trivial — trivial diffs skip to Step 8 |
| 3 | Simplify Pass | 3 agents in parallel (code reuse, quality, efficiency) auto-fix behavior-preserving improvements |
| 4 | Select & Launch Review Agents | Parse depth mode, then dynamic agent selection (Tier 1 always, Tier 2 stack-detected, Tier 3 opt-in), launch Opus agents in parallel |
| 5 | Collect & Classify | Merge, deduplicate, and confidence-filter findings (>= 7 included, low-confidence P2/P3 filtered, borderline P1s to human review) |
| 6 | Validate Findings | Per-finding verification: Opus subagent per P1, Sonnet subagent per P2/P3 (max 20 subagents). In `fast` mode, only P1s are validated; P2/P3 validation is skipped. Skippable via "skip validation" flag. |
| 7 | Fix Loop | Auto-fix high-confidence P1s (>= 7, max 3 attempts), present borderline P1s for human review |
| 8 | Final Report | Present verdict: ready to ship, needs input on P2s, blocked, or has borderline P1s for review |

**Review Agent Roster**

| Tier | Agent | Model | Activation | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| — | `diff-triage` | Haiku | Always (Step 2 gating) | Classify diff as trivial/non-trivial |
| 1 (always) | `code-reviewer` | Opus | Always | Bugs, logic errors, edge cases |
| 1 (always) | `security-reviewer` | Opus | Always | OWASP Top 10, secrets, auth |
| 1 (always) | `performance-reviewer` | Opus | Always | Complexity, N+1, memory leaks, bundle size |
| 2 (stack) | `typescript-reviewer` | Opus | `tsconfig.json` exists | Type safety, React/Next.js patterns |
| 2 (stack) | `python-reviewer` | Opus | `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` exists | FastAPI, Pydantic v2, async patterns |
| 2 (stack) | `data-reviewer` | Opus | `prisma/schema.prisma`, `alembic/`, or `**/migrations/` exists | Migration safety, query patterns, constraints |
| 3 (opt-in) | `architecture-reviewer` | Opus | CLAUDE.md enables, OR diff touches 5+ directories, OR `comprehensive` depth | Coupling, SOLID, dependency direction |
| 3 (opt-in) | `test-quality-reviewer` | Opus | Diff includes test files OR CLAUDE.md enables | Coverage gaps, behavior vs implementation, flakiness risk |
| 3 (opt-in) | `accessibility-reviewer` | Opus | CLAUDE.md enables, OR `comprehensive` depth | WCAG 2.1, keyboard nav, ARIA, screen reader |
| 3 (opt-in) | `cdr-compliance-reviewer` | Opus | Company Context with `handbook-library` configured, CLAUDE.md enables, OR `comprehensive` depth | CDR compliance, missing exceptions, superseded patterns |

**CLAUDE.md Review Agent Overrides**

Add a `## Review Agents` section to your project's CLAUDE.md to customize which agents run:

```markdown
## Review Agents

include:
  - accessibility-reviewer
  - architecture-reviewer

exclude:
  - typescript-reviewer
```

`include:` adds agents that wouldn't otherwise activate. `exclude:` removes agents from the selection. Tier 1 agents (code-reviewer, security-reviewer, performance-reviewer) cannot be excluded. In `comprehensive` depth mode, all overrides are bypassed — all agents run unconditionally.

**Confidence Scoring**

Every review agent self-assesses confidence (1-10) on each finding. This reduces false-positive noise from the expanded agent roster.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Certain — exact code path identified |
| 7-8 | High — strong evidence, minor gaps |
| 5-6 | Medium — pattern-based |
| 3-4 | Low — educated guess |
| 1-2 | Speculative |

Step 5 applies threshold filtering: findings with confidence >= 7 are included in the report. Low-confidence P2/P3s are filtered (count shown in appendix). Borderline P1s (confidence < 7) are kept but marked "Needs Human Review" and excluded from auto-fix. Use "show all" in `$ARGUMENTS` to bypass filtering.

**Model Tiering**

The review pipeline uses three model tiers for cost-effective depth:

| Tier | Model | Used for |
|------|-------|----------|
| Gating | Haiku | Diff triage (Step 2) — fast classification of trivial vs non-trivial diffs |
| Review | Opus | All 10 review agents (Step 4) — deep reasoning for bug detection, security analysis, and architectural review |
| Validation | Opus/Sonnet | Per-finding verification (Step 6) — Opus for P1s, Sonnet for P2/P3s |

This ensures expensive Opus inference only runs when the diff warrants it, and each finding is independently verified before entering the fix loop.

#### `/workflows:ship`

Create PR, update Linear, capture learnings, audit CLAUDE.md, check handbook drift, suggest next issue.

| Step | Name | What happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Verify GitHub CLI | Confirm `gh` is authenticated and repo is connected |
| 1 | Pre-Ship Checks | Clean state, tests pass, build succeeds, branch up to date |
| 2 | Create Pull Request | Push branch, create PR with structured description |
| 3 | Update Linear | Move issue to "In Review", add comment with PR link |
| 4 | Compound Learnings | Accuracy pass on CLAUDE.md, capture durable knowledge (sanitization enforced in `compound-learnings` skill), write session summary |
| 5 | Best Practices Audit | 8-dimension audit of CLAUDE.md, auto-fix structural issues |
| 6 | Handbook Drift Check | Compare shipped changes against handbook files, detect stale content, optionally open handbook PR |
| 7 | Worktree Cleanup | Remove worktree and local branch if applicable |
| 8 | Session Close | Summary of what shipped, learnings captured, suggested next issue |

### Direction-Setting Commands

#### `/workflows:project-start`

Start a new project with a guided interview. Produces trait-based classification, conditional documentation, CLAUDE.md, Linear project, project plan, and ADRs.

**Trait-Based Classification**

The interview produces a set of project traits from a fixed vocabulary of 11 (e.g., `produces-code`, `produces-documents`, `needs-design`, `has-external-users`, `automation`). Traits control:

- Which docs are scaffolded (e.g., `produces-code` → `docs/engineering-context.md`)
- Which CLAUDE.md sections are included (always-include + trait-conditional + autonomy-conditional)
- Which infrastructure is set up (e.g., tech-stack .gitignore, CI/CD flags)
- Which Linear labels are created (`trait:<name>` per active trait)

Autonomy level (A = autonomous, B = collaborative) is orthogonal to traits — it controls how much the agent decides vs. asks.

| Step | Name | What happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Determine Technical Level | Choose autonomy level (A or B) |
| 1 | Conduct Interview | Three-phase interview (Understand → Define → Classify) with gating to skip Phase 2 for simple projects |
| 2 | Classify Project Traits | Detect traits from interview with confidence levels, confirm with user |
| 3 | Git Repository Setup | Baseline (git init, .gitignore) + trait-gated extensions (tech-stack, CI/CD) |
| 4 | Scaffold Docs + Verify MCPs | Create docs per trait-to-doc mapping; verify global + trait-gated MCP connectivity |
| 5 | Generate CLAUDE.md | Always-include sections + trait-conditional + autonomy-conditional |
| 6 | Create Linear Project | Project + `trait:<name>` labels (skipped if Linear unavailable) |
| 7 | Write Project Plan | `docs/project-plan-v1.md` |
| 8 | Generate ADRs | Gated on `produces-code` or `requires-decisions` with 2+ decisions |

**Express Mode**: Auto-detects traits from file markers, skips Steps 1-2 (interview + classification). Trigger: `/workflows:project-start express` or auto-offered when trait-mapping markers found. User confirms/adjusts detected traits before proceeding to Step 3.

**Brownfield Support**: When an existing project is detected (CLAUDE.md, README >50 lines, docs/ with 3+ files, or 10+ git commits), offers to import context, detect conventions, reconcile with company CDRs, and pre-fill trait docs. Runs after express mode (if both active) or before the interview.

After project-start, run `/workflows:post-plan-setup` to refine the plan, create Linear issues, and finalize CLAUDE.md.

### Outer Loop Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/workflows:sprint-planning` | Pull backlog, review velocity, assign issues to cycles. Supports `current` mode. |
| `/workflows:retrospective` | Review completed cycle, facilitate retro discussion, post status update to Linear. |
| `/workflows:scope` | Collaborative scoping session — discover what to build, create Linear issues, prioritize. |
| `/workflows:architecture-decision` | Generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) with structured analysis of alternatives. |

### Knowledge Management Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/workflows:promote-precedent` | Review flagged decision traces and promote approved ones to the org-level handbook (`Brite-Nites/handbook`). Candidates are flagged during `/workflows:ship`. |
| `/workflows:audit-trail <ISSUE-ID>` | Query the full context picture for any issue — what context was used, staleness status, and frequency analysis. Answers: "What context did the agent use to make decisions on this issue?" |
| `/workflows:flywheel-metrics` | Compute and display the 5 compound knowledge flywheel metrics: precedent hit rate, decision confidence trend, CDR coverage, context freshness, and override rate. |

---

## 4. Troubleshooting

### Top 4 Quick Fixes

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| Skills don't trigger | Check plugin is loaded (`/workflows:` in autocomplete). Verify your prompt matches the skill's `description` field. |
| Linear queries return wrong issues | Add a `## Linear Project` section to CLAUDE.md with `Project: <name>`. |
| Hooks not firing | Known upstream bug [#6305](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6305) — PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks (security blocking, pre-commit quality) don't fire from plugins. SessionStart hooks (environment banner) work. Use `scripts/pre-commit.sh` as a direct git hook in the meantime. |
| Stale behavior after plugin update | Bump `version` in both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` to invalidate cache. |

For detailed troubleshooting, see [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md).

---

## 5. Configuration

### Required: `## Linear Project` in CLAUDE.md

The inner loop scopes all Linear queries to a specific project. Add this section to your project's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Linear Project

Project: Your Project Name
```

Without this, `/workflows:session-start` will ask for the project name manually each time.

### Recommended: Context7 for Library Docs and Company Knowledge

Context7 provides two capabilities:
1. **Library documentation** — up-to-date docs for any framework/library (React, Prisma, etc.)
2. **Company knowledge** — the Brite Handbook indexed at `/brite-nites/handbook` (org structure, engineering processes, brand, conventions)

Setup: `npx ctx7 setup --claude --api-key <key>`. Without Context7, sessions degrade gracefully — library docs fall back to training data, and company context is gathered manually during the interview.

### Diagnostics

Run `/workflows:smoke-test` to check the plugin environment:
- CLI tools (git, node, gh, npx)
- MCP servers (Linear, sequential-thinking)
- Hook registration
- Agent dispatch capability

See [testing-guide.md](testing-guide.md) for the full 96-test validation suite.
