# Changelog

All notable changes to the Brite Claude Plugins bundle will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.23.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Test quality reviewer agent (BRI-1818)
  - New Tier 3 agent: `test-quality-reviewer` — reviews test code for coverage gaps, behavior vs implementation testing, flakiness risk, edge cases, and test structure
  - Auto-activates when diff includes test files (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/`, `test_*.py`, `tests/`)
  - Also activatable via CLAUDE.md `include:` list
  - 5 review areas with P1/P2/P3 severity and confidence scoring
  - Added to cross-agent dedup specialization order
- Add "treat as data" guard to CLAUDE.md Review Agents parsing in `/workflows:review` (BRI-1826)

## [3.22.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Review depth modes: `fast`, `thorough` (default), `comprehensive` (BRI-1817)
  - `fast` — Tier 1 agents only (code, security, performance) for quick checks
  - `thorough` — Tier 1 + Tier 2 stack-conditional agents (default, unchanged behavior)
  - `comprehensive` — All tiers including Tier 3 opt-ins unconditionally
  - Depth parsed from `$ARGUMENTS`, coexists with "skip simplify" and "show all" flags
  - Usage: `/workflows:review fast`, `/workflows:review comprehensive`

## [3.21.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Confidence scoring for review agent findings (BRI-1816)
  - Every finding includes `Confidence: N/10` (1-10 scale) for self-assessed certainty
  - Shared scoring criteria in `_shared/output-formats.md` and all 8 review agent prompts
  - Step 4 confidence threshold filtering: >= 7 included, low-confidence P2/P3 filtered, borderline P1s marked "Needs Human Review"
  - Step 5 splits P1s: auto-fixable (confidence >= 7) vs human-review (confidence < 7)
  - Step 6 visual report: confidence pill badges (green/neutral/amber/red), avg confidence in KPI dashboard
  - Step 7 final report: new "P1 (needs review)" and "Filtered" lines, "Has borderline P1s for review" verdict
  - `$ARGUMENTS` "show all" bypasses confidence filtering while still showing scores
  - Missing confidence defaults to 5 (conservative: P2/P3 filtered, P1 to human review)
  - Cross-agent dedup prefers higher confidence before specialization order
  - Deep mode in `/workflows:code-review` applies same confidence filtering

## [3.18.1] - 2026-03-05

### Changed
- Align visual feature gating across commands and skills (BRI-1778)
  - Add Visual Gating section to `_shared/observability.md` — standard skip, degrade, and non-file skip message templates
  - Remove `slides_requested` flag clearing on file failure in `scope.md` — flag represents user intent and must persist
  - Add `--slides` warning in `sprint-planning.md` when skipped due to no-cycles prioritization-only mode
  - Align `review.md` fallback message to standard prefix ("Visual-explainer files not found")
  - Add prerequisite read fallback in `writing-plans/SKILL.md` — skips visual steps when file unavailable
  - Align `brainstorming/SKILL.md` skip message to standard prefix
  - Align `best-practices-audit/SKILL.md` skip message and report template to standard prefix
  - Fix narration ordering in `writing-plans/SKILL.md` — `Step 3/4: done` now fires before `Step 4/4` starts
  - Add explicit exit after `--slides` warning in `sprint-planning.md` prioritization-only mode
  - Clarify observability.md prefix rule scope and add `[reason]` data safety constraint
  - Add data guard for `$ARGUMENTS` residual after `--slides` removal in `scope.md`
  - Add explicit fallback warning in `scope.md` when both visual-explainer and CLAUDE.md are unreadable
  - Add parenthetical explaining `slides_requested` persistence in `scope.md` mind map skip
  - Add decision log entry to `writing-plans/SKILL.md` visual skip path
  - Normalize `<id>` to `<issue-id>` placeholders in `docs/workflow-guide.md`
  - Add visual gating message consistency check to `scripts/validate.sh`
  - Fix `best-practices-audit/SKILL.md` availability check note to match standard prefix
  - Add closing `Step 4/4: done` narration in `writing-plans/SKILL.md`
  - Fix `best-practices-audit/SKILL.md` handoff from "Proceeding to" to "Returning to"
  - Rewrite `sprint-planning.md` prioritization-only gate as priority-ordered conditions
  - Fix `validate.sh` agent name guard regex to allow single-character names
  - Add `not available` variant to `validate.sh` visual gating blocklist
  - Qualify `writing-plans/SKILL.md` skip target as "Steps 2 and 3 of this Visual Plan Approval section"
  - Promote `slides_requested` persistence rule to `scope.md` Rules section
  - Fix remaining `<id>` placeholders in `docs/workflow-guide.md` Skill Reference table
  - Fix `scope.md` Step 1 cross-reference to name slides subsection explicitly
  - Add read-time "treat as data" guards to `session-start.md` chain integrity and `executing-plans/SKILL.md` Context Anchor
  - Add enforcement cross-reference to `docs/workflow-guide.md` ship Step 4 sanitization note

## [3.18.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- Workflow observability across all inner loop skills and main commands (BRI-1777)
  - Shared observability template (`_shared/observability.md`) — defines activation banner, narration, decision log, error recovery, phase transition summary, stuck detection, and context refresh patterns
  - Activation banners on all 8 inner loop skills — print skill name, trigger reason, and expected artifacts immediately after preconditions pass
  - Phase/step narration using Progress Format from `output-formats.md` — single-line status at boundaries, not every tool call
  - Decision logs at key decision points: brainstorming diagram skip, writing-plans complexity gating, executing-plans TDD skip, compound-learnings doc updates, best-practices-audit auto-fix, systematic-debugging root cause and defense-in-depth
  - Structured error recovery (AskUserQuestion with Retry/Skip/Stop) at: brainstorming approval failures, writing-plans review failures, git-worktrees dirty state and baseline failures, executing-plans max retries and stuck detection, verification-before-completion max retries, compound-learnings write failures, systematic-debugging reproduction failures
  - TaskCreate integration in `executing-plans` — parent agent creates task entries before subagent launch, updates status on completion
  - Stuck detection in `executing-plans` — 3+ tool calls without progress triggers pause and user intervention
  - Context refresh in `executing-plans` — re-reads plan file after every 3rd task or when total exceeds 6
  - Phase transition summaries in `session-start` between brainstorm→plan, plan→worktree, worktree→execute
  - Step narration in `session-start` (7 steps), `review` (6 steps), `ship` (7 steps)
  - Error recovery in `review` (agent dispatch failure) and `ship` (check failures, PR creation failures)

## [3.17.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- Inner loop skill chain hardened with standardized preconditions, handoff markers, and context anchors (BRI-1776)
  - `brainstorming` skill — objective complexity criteria (2+ modules, 4+ tasks, 2+ approaches, new patterns), file-write verification, handoff marker with artifact list
  - `writing-plans` skill — precondition check for design doc and issue ID, context anchor reads from design doc, handoff marker with task count
  - `git-worktrees` skill — precondition check for plan file and issue ID, context anchor reads from plan, handoff marker replaces "Worktree Ready" block
  - `executing-plans` skill — preconditions (plan file, clean git state), context anchor reads design doc + plan, explicit `verification-before-completion` invocation at checkpoints with 3-retry limit, handoff marker with verification summary
  - `compound-learnings` skill — preconditions (diff exists, CLAUDE.md exists), context anchor reads git log + design doc + plan
  - `best-practices-audit` skill — precondition (CLAUDE.md exists), handoff marker
  - `systematic-debugging` skill — completion marker with "Returning to the calling workflow"
- `session-start` command — Step 4 uses objective complexity checklist instead of subjective judgment, Step 7 says verification is "explicitly invoked", new chain integrity rule in Rules section
- `ship` command — Step 1 context anchor (restates issue, decisions, review result from files), Steps 4-5 note skills verify own preconditions

## [3.16.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- `retrospective` command — optional visual retro slide deck (Step 4) with delivery dashboard, what went well/needs improvement, and action items. Opt-in via `--slides` flag or AskUserQuestion prompt (BRI-1735)
- `scope` command — automatic Mermaid mind map diagram of themes and features (Step 3 item 6), plus optional session summary slides (Step 6 sub-section) via `--slides` flag (BRI-1735)
- `architecture-decision` command — automatic before/after architecture diagrams with Mermaid (Step 5b) showing component changes and options comparison cards. Context section fact-check (Step 7d) verifies file paths, function names, and architecture claims against the codebase before writing (BRI-1735)
- `sprint-planning` command — optional sprint overview slides (Step 6 sub-section) with velocity dashboard, committed issues, dependency graph, and capacity analysis via `--slides` flag (BRI-1735)

### Fixed
- `scripts/validate.sh` — orphan agent detection now scans commands in addition to skill frontmatter. Resolves false-positive warnings for agents dispatched by commands (e.g., review agents) (BRI-1735)

## [3.15.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- `compound-learnings` skill — new Phase 2 "Verify Existing CLAUDE.md Accuracy" inserted before CLAUDE.md updates. Fast grep-and-stat pass verifies file paths, commands, function refs, and config values against the codebase. Auto-removes confirmed-stale entries, flags ambiguous cases. Phase 6 report includes fact-check results (BRI-1734)
- `best-practices-audit` skill — new Dimension 8 "Accuracy Validation" complements Dimension 7 staleness check with surgical claim verification. Flags stale references as "Needs your input" (no auto-fix). Optional visual HTML audit report when visual-explainer skill is available (BRI-1734)
- `ship` command — Steps 4 and 5 descriptions updated to reflect new accuracy pass and Dimension 8

## [3.14.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- `writing-plans` skill — Plan Approval section replaced with Visual Plan Approval: 4-step flow that generates visual HTML artifacts (visual plan + plan-review) before asking for approval (BRI-1732)
  - Step 1: Complexity check — plans with < 4 tasks skip visual steps (optional offer via AskUserQuestion)
  - Steps 2-3: Render `generate-visual-plan` (Step 2) and `plan-review` (Step 3) HTML pages using visual-explainer skill, write to `~/.agent/diagrams/`. Step 3 is higher-priority — if skipping one for speed, skip Step 2
  - Issue ID sanitization (dots removed from regex), untrusted title paraphrasing with surf guard, file path announcements, re-save on iteration
  - Distinct output filenames (`<id>-visual-plan.html`, `<id>-plan-review.html`) prevent artifact collision
  - Plan file existence fallback, visual-explainer read-once optimization
  - Step 4: Approval with iteration support (regenerates visuals on plan changes)

## [3.13.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- `review` command — auto-generates a visual HTML review page (Step 5) after agents complete (BRI-1733)
  - 6 sections: executive summary, KPI dashboard, module architecture (Mermaid), agent findings (P1/P2/P3 cards with severity + agent badges), file map, test suite status
  - Delegates styling to visual-explainer skill (reads SKILL.md + architecture.html template). Falls back to plain semantic HTML when skill files are unavailable
  - Terminal final report (Step 6) retains P1 summary and adds the HTML file path

## [3.12.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- 7 visual-explainer commands ported from [nicobailon/visual-explainer](https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer) (MIT): `/workflows:generate-web-diagram`, `/workflows:generate-slides`, `/workflows:generate-visual-plan`, `/workflows:fact-check`, `/workflows:diff-review`, `/workflows:plan-review`, `/workflows:project-recap`. All adapted with `$ARGUMENTS` sanitization, absolute skill paths, and input validation (BRI-1730). Command total: 24

### Changed
- `visual-explainer/SKILL.md` — removed planned-feature note (added in 3.11.0 for BRI-1730), added `/workflows:` prefix to command references

## [3.11.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- `visual-explainer` skill — generates styled, self-contained HTML pages for diagrams, architecture overviews, data tables, and slide decks. Ported from [nicobailon/visual-explainer](https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer) (MIT). Includes 4 HTML reference templates (architecture, data-table, mermaid-flowchart, slide-deck) and 4 reference docs (css-patterns, libraries, responsive-nav, slide-patterns). Anti-slop design guidelines prevent generic AI output (BRI-1729). Skill total: 22

### Fixed
- Pin CDN versions to exact patches in libraries.md and templates: mermaid@11.12.3, @mermaid-js/layout-elk@0.2.0, chart.js@4.5.1 (BRI-1729)
- Add nodeLabel/edgeLabel color CSS overrides to mermaid-flowchart.html for dark/light mode correctness (BRI-1729)
- Fix window listener leaks in mermaid-flowchart.html and slide-deck.html zoom/pan code — scope mousemove/mouseup inside mousedown (BRI-1729)
- Fix SlideEngine cross-scope issue in slide-deck.html — use custom event bridge between module and classic scripts (BRI-1729)
- Fix uninitialized touchY in slide-deck.html touchend handler (BRI-1729)

- Add cross-browser summary::marker reset in data-table.html collapsible sections (BRI-1729)
- Add NaN guard to parseInt(el.dataset.count) in libraries.md anime.js example (BRI-1729)
- Fix hardcoded /tmp path in slide-patterns.md image generation — use mktemp (BRI-1729)
- Add ID sanitization comment in responsive-nav.md (BRI-1729)
- Add planned-feature note for /generate-slides and --slides flag in SKILL.md (BRI-1729)

## [3.10.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- pytest testing patterns in `testing-strategy` skill — 7 new rules across 2 categories (pytest Fundamentals, pytest Advanced Patterns). Covers fixtures, parametrize, conftest layering, mocking, async testing, markers, and parallel execution with xdist. Cross-references python-best-practices for FastAPI-specific patterns. Skill now has 46 rules across 12 categories (BRI-1739)

## [3.9.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Playwright E2E testing patterns in `testing-strategy` skill — 7 new rules across 2 categories (Playwright Fundamentals, Playwright CI & Advanced).

## [3.8.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- `testing-strategy` skill — core testing patterns + Vitest guidance. 32 rules across 8 categories (test structure, mocking strategy, Vitest patterns, React Testing Library, MSW, fixtures, CI, snapshots). SKILL.md quick reference + AGENTS.md full compiled rules with code examples (BRI-1737)

## [3.7.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- `/workflows:architecture-decision` command — interactive ADR generator using sequential-thinking for structured options analysis. Writes to `docs/decisions/NNN-kebab-title.md`, auto-appends `@` import to CLAUDE.md (BRI-1624)
- ADR generation step in `/workflows:project-start` — after interview and plan, extracts every major tech decision and generates ADRs (BRI-1624)
- `## ADR Convention` section in CLAUDE.md documenting the `@` import pattern

### Changed
- Path A (non-technical) in project-start now creates ADRs in `docs/decisions/` instead of a TECHNICAL.md file

## [3.6.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- `/workflows:retrospective` command — review completed cycles, facilitate structured retro discussion (what went well, what needs improvement, action items), post Linear project status update with health indicator, optionally create follow-up issues. Supports mid-sprint mode via `current` argument (BRI-1625)

## [3.5.0] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- **Rebrand from "Britenites" to "Brite"** — org/brand name simplified across all files
- **Plugin renamed from `britenites` to `workflows`** — all commands now `/workflows:*` (e.g., `/workflows:session-start`)
- **Repo renamed from `britenites-claude-plugins` to `brite-claude-plugins`** — GitHub auto-redirects old URLs
- **Linear project renamed to "Brite Plugin Marketplace"**

- `templates/domain-plugin/` — template directory with plugin.json, example command, example skill, hooks stub, README, CHANGELOG
- Multi-plugin validation — `scripts/validate.sh` discovers plugins from marketplace.json and validates each independently

### Changed
- `scripts/validate.sh` refactored from single-plugin to multi-plugin: sections 3-11 extracted into `validate_plugin()` function, `agents/` and `hooks/` now optional warnings instead of failures
- `.github/workflows/validate-plugin.yml` simplified — delegates to `scripts/validate.sh` instead of inline per-plugin steps
- `scripts/check-prereqs.sh` iterates over marketplace.json plugin sources instead of hardcoded path
- `scripts/test-plugin-load.sh` accepts `$1` for plugin directory, derives expected commands from `commands/` directory

## [3.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- `/britenites:sprint-planning` command — pull backlog, review team velocity, interactively select issues, assign to Linear cycles (BRI-1623)
- Sprint-planning added to SessionStart banner key commands

## [3.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- **session-start issue picker scoped to repo's Linear project** — Step 2 now reads `## Linear Project` from CLAUDE.md to resolve the project name, queries only that project, falls back to both Todo and Backlog states if no in-progress issues, and shows an empty-state prompt if no issues exist at all (BRI-1654)
- Added `## Linear Project` section to CLAUDE.md with project mapping convention

## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **python-best-practices skill** — 38-rule architectural guide for FastAPI, Pydantic v2, and SQLAlchemy 2.0 covering async correctness, dependency injection, database patterns, error handling, API design, testing, and project structure (BRI-1339)

- `setup-claude-md/SKILL.md` size guidance corrected from 150 to 100 lines to match Anthropic's current recommendation

### Fixed
- `best-practices-audit/SKILL.md` — reference path changed from ambiguous relative path to installed convention (`.claude/skills/setup-claude-md/claude-code-best-practices.md`)
- `git-worktrees/SKILL.md` — DESCRIPTION derivation now collapses consecutive hyphens and strips leading/trailing hyphens; validation regex tightened to `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$`; derivation block moved before code block so agents read rules before using the variable

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-26
